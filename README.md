# Crowd-Funding

This is a Crowd Funding system, the way NGOs work. This runs on a blockchain so it provides transparency in the system and trust to the donor. The target amount and Deadline for the donation need to fix to deploy the smart contract, only the manager can deploy this contract. A minimum of 100wei is needed for the contribution. Contributors have the authority to see the Target amount, the deadline for the target, see the total contract balance, who the manager is, the total no. of contributions, what is the minimum contribution amount. The contributor can also ask for a refund, if the raised amount has reached the target and the deadline is over then the contributor can get back its refund. If anyone needs the donation he can give a request to the manager with a description of why they need it, their wallet address, and the amount they need. The request will be decided with the help of voting by the contributors only if more than 50% of contributors agree to the request the requester will get the donation. Contributors can see all the requests for donations with their detail and give their vote on that.
